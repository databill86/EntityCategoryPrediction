Many see the realms of literature and computers as not just completely separate, but growing more distant from one another all the time. Donald Knuth, one of the most respected figures of all the most deeply computer-savvy in Silicon Valley, sees it differently. His claims to fame include The Art of Computer Programming, an ongoing multi-volume series of books whose publication began more than fifty years ago.

Now everyone can get more than a taste of Knuth's perspective and thoughts on computers, programming, and a host of related subjects on the youtube channel of Stanford University, where Donald Knuth is now professor emeritus.

Stanford's online archive of Donald Knuth lectures now numbers 110, ranging across the decades and covering such subjects as the usage and mechanics of TeX, the analysis of algorithms, and the nature of mathematical writing.

Anti-corruption campaigner Alexey Navalny has long been the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin.

He has called Mr Putin's party a place of "crooks and thieves", accused the president's system of "sucking the blood out of Russia" and vowed to destroy the "feudal state" being built.

He has led nationwide protests against the authorities.

But he has not been able to fulfil what is, perhaps, his biggest dream: challenge Mr Putin in the ballot box.

His candidacy in the 2018 presidential election was banned by authorities over his conviction by a Russian court of embezzlement, which bars him from running for office.
Alexey Navalny vehemently denies the accusations, saying his legal troubles are Kremlin reprisals for his fierce criticism.
